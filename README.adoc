= DAO (Data Access Object)

A DAO (Data Access Object) is a design pattern that provides an interface to interact with a database or any other persistence mechanism. It encapsulates the logic for accessing and manipulating data, allowing the rest of the application to be decoupled from the underlying data storage.

== Creating a DAO

To create a DAO, you typically follow these steps:

1. Define an interface that specifies the operations to be performed on the data.
2. Implement the interface with a concrete class that interacts with the data storage.
3. Use the DAO in your application to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.

[source,java]
----
public interface UserDao {
    User findById(int id);
    List<User> findAll();
    void save(User user);
    void update(User user);
    void delete(User user);
}

public class UserDaoImpl implements UserDao {
    // Implementation details
}

== Benefits of using a DAO

Using a DAO has several benefits, including:

- Separation of concerns: The DAO isolates the data access logic from the rest of the application, making it easier to maintain and test.
- Code reusability: The DAO can be reused across different parts of the application, promoting code reuse and reducing duplication.
- Database independence: The DAO abstracts the underlying data storage, allowing you to switch databases or persistence mechanisms without affecting the rest of the application.

== Do write/code but generate.

The DAO above implies that an interface needs to be written and then a concrete class needs to be written. This is a lot of boilerplate code that can be generated.
To make the generator less complex, we set some constraints:
* The interface is generic and may have an abstract helper subclass that takes away the need to generate a lot of code.
* The is a also a rule for the entities: The entity can have at most one id fiueld, typically the primary key. This is a constraint that is often used in practice.
** That id field must be of type int, long, or the wrapper classes of these types.
* Other generated fields are not of these types, and when generation is required, then a gerator `Spupplier<T>` must be given.




== Conclusion

The DAO pattern is a powerful tool for managing data access in your application. By encapsulating the data access logic in a separate layer, you can achieve better separation of concerns and improve the maintainability and testability of your code.
